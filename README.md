# Handwritten-Digit-Classification-using-ANN


This project is a handwritten digit classification system that uses Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). ANNs are a type of machine learning algorithm that are inspired by the way the human brain works.

# Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the MNIST dataset, which is a collection of 70,000 handwritten digits (0-9) that have been preprocessed and standardized. The dataset is split into 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images.
