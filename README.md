# Handwritten-Digit-Classification-using-ANN


This project is a handwritten digit classification system that uses Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). ANNs are a type of machine learning algorithm that are inspired by the way the human brain works.

# Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the MNIST dataset, which is a collection of 70,000 handwritten digits (0-9) that have been preprocessed and standardized.

# Requirements
To run this project, you need to have the following installed:

1.Python 3 <br>
2.TensorFlow <br>
3.Keras <br>
4.NumPy <br>
5.Matplotlib <br>

# Future Work
In the future, we plan to explore other machine learning algorithms and compare their performance to the ANN model. We also plan to implement a user interface where users can input their own handwritten digits and have the model classify them.
